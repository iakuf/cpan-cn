=head1 NAME

Pegex::Regex - Use Pegex Like a Regex

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    {
        # Turn on Pegex regular expressions in lexical scope.
        use Pegex::Regex;
        my $grammar = qr{$grammar_text}x;
        $text =~ $grammar;
        my $result = \%/;

        # Turn off Pegex in this scope.
        no Pegex::Regex;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a trivial sugar module that lets you use Pegex parser grammars like
regular expressions, if you're into that kind of thing.

这主要是克隆了 Damian Conway's L<Regexp::Grammars> 模块的 API.
当你给 grammar 语法放到 C<qr{...}x>, 并用这个来处理输入的你想解析的字符.
如果解析正常， 你可以从 C<%/> 中取得数据结构.

IMHO, building a recursive decscent parser entirely inside of a regular
expression, is not the clearest way to code. But, of course, TMTOWTDI. :)

=head1 NOTE

This module is just for experimental fun. See L<Pegex> for the right way to
use the Pegex parsing framework.

=head1 TMTOWTDI

这是 Pegex::Regex 代码片断:

    use Pegex::Regex;
    $text =~ qr{... Pegex grammar text ...};
    $data = \%/;

这相当于 Pegex 代码:

    use Pegex;
    my $data = pegex('... Pegex grammar text ...')->parse($text);

=head1 WARNING

This gateway drug, er, module, technically should not even work.

It turns your "grammar inside a regexp" into a Pegex::Grammar using qr{}
overloading, and then turns your regexp itself into a shim that calls the
parse method for you. This is highly magical and technically makes a reentrant
call to the regex engine, which is not supported yet. Use at your own risk.

Better yet, do yourself a favor and learn how to use the Pegex toolset without
this ::Regex sugar. C<:-)>

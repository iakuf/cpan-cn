=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::Handle - AnyEvent 的非阻塞  I/O 处理 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use AnyEvent;
   use AnyEvent::Handle;

   my $cv = AnyEvent->condvar;

   my $hdl; $hdl = new AnyEvent::Handle
      fh => \*STDIN,
      on_error => sub {
         my ($hdl, $fatal, $msg) = @_;
         AE::log error => $msg;
         $hdl->destroy;
         $cv->send;
      };

   # send some request line
   $hdl->push_write ("getinfo\015\012");

   # read the response line
   $hdl->push_read (line => sub {
      my ($hdl, $line) = @_;
      say "got line <$line>";
      $cv->send;
   });

   $cv->recv;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

这是一个帮助，告诉你怎么在流上写基于事件 I/O 句柄的操作(sockets，管道和其它的流处理).

在  L<AnyEvent::Intro> 包含着一些 AnyEvent::Handle 的示例.

在下面的文档中指的 "bytes" 是意味着字符，象 sysread 和 syswrite 能在所有的 I/O 的地方操作他们。所有和字符有关的模块也一样.

最少你需要指定  C<fh>  或 C<connect>, 和 C<on_error>  的回调.

全部的回调会给句柄对象做为第一个参数.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $handle = B<new> AnyEvent::Handle fh => $filehandle, key => value...

构造函数支持这些参数 (全部是 C<< key => value >> 对).

=over 4

=item fh => $filehandle     [C<fh> or C<connect> MANDATORY]

这个句柄会使用 L<AnyEvent::Handle> 对象来操作。

注意： 这个句柄会被构造函数设置成 non-blocking mode (使用 C<AnyEvent::Util::fh_nonblocking>) 。

=item connect => [$host, $service]      [C<fh> or C<connect> MANDATORY]

尝试连接到指定的主机($host)和服务($service 端口), 使用的是 C<AnyEvent::Socket::tcp_connect>. 这个 C<$host> 会变成默认的 C<peername>。

您必须指定使用此 C<fh> 参数.

它可能会推请求到读和写的队列上，并修改流的属性，使用 AnyEvent::Handle 来操作连接.

当设置了  C<on_prepare>, C<on_connect_error> 和 C<on_connect> 的回调，会在适当的时候调用这些回调。

=over 4

=item on_prepare => $cb->($handle)

这个回调并不常用，它是在创建连接之前，创建句柄之后被调用，所以这时已经可以访问 C<< $handle->{fh} >> 了。它可以用于设置句柄所需要的连接所使用的参数，因为还没有建立连接，所以可以更改设置.

这个回调要返回连接超时的值以秒为单位(C<0> 或 C<undef> 或 空的列表，以表明默认要使用的超时时间)

=item on_connect => $cb->($handle, $host, $port, $retry->())

当连接已经成功建立时，调用这个回调函数。

这行中的 $host, $port 是做为套接字的参数，加上重试的回调。在这个连接的时候会调用读和写的队列，其中有一些如 EOF 的状态,TLS 的状态和类似的句柄都会被 reset.

在这个地方是不能使用读写队列来处理句柄的连接的。

如果因为一些原因，这个句柄不能用的时候，就会调用 $retry 来连接下一个目标(例如，多个解析的地址记录)。在连接调用返回后就会调用 $retry 的调用。一开始建连的时候，如果失败会连接下一个主机地址.

在大多的时候，你并不需要使用 $retry 的参数.

=item on_connect_error => $cb->($handle, $message)

当无法建议连接时，这个回调会被调用， C<$!> 会包含相关的错误代码， C<$message> 会包含一些消息(通常是和 C<"$!"> 一样);

        
如果不指定此回调，后面的 C<on_error> 将调用一个致命错误

=back

=item on_error => $cb->($handle, $fatal, $message)

这是错误时的回调，当调用这个时,说明有一些错误出现，例如象不能解析主机名，失败的连接，读错误.

有些错误是致命的( C<$fatcl> 会被设置成真).当出现 fatal 的错误,句柄的对象会被 destroyed (通过调用 C<< -> destroy >>), 后才调用错误回调，所以你可以随意检查句柄对象。常用的致命错误的例子是当一个活动的读 watcher （C<EPIPE> 进程没处理 Socket 错误继续向 TCP 写入数据）时发生 EOF 条件或 I/O 错误。

AnyEvent::Handle 会试图找到对应合适的错误代码，但有些时候象 (TLS 错误),并不一定能很好的工作.

如果您报告错误给用户，建议在人类可读的错误信息 (所以并不建议你直接输出 C<"$!"> );

如果你真想输出这些错误 ，你最好看看和 C<Errno> 文档来比较一下 C<$!> ，然后提供信息.

只要是非致命错误(  C<Non-fatal> ),你可以简单的重试和忽略，常用的非致命错误的例子是超时  C<ETIMEDOUT> 和 C<EBADMSG>。

在进入回调时， C<$!> 会包含着操作系统的错误代码(C<ENOSPC>, C<EPIPE>, C<ETIMEDOUT>, C<EBADMSG> or C<EPROTO>).

虽然不是强制性的, 但我还是建议设置这个回调，这样不会出现很多错误报告，不然会调用 C<croak>.

=item on_read => $cb->($handle)

这是设置默认的读回调, 就是当有数据到达(可读时)，并且没有任何读取请求在队列中时调用,这个不象 push_read 需要条件成立时才读，这个只要有一个字节都能读取.

你可以访问和删除 read buffer.使用 C<< ->rbuf >> 的方法来访问  C<< $handle->{rbuf} >> 就行了。注意你不能增加和修改 read buffer.但是可以删除.

你可以调用 C<< ->push_read (...) >>  和其它相当的功能来修改 read queue.

当 EOF 条件成立的时候, AnyEvent::Handle 会首先试着给队列中的数据来使用  C<on_read> 这个回调处理，处理完后调用  C<on_eof> 的回调。如果这个过程出现了问题全设置 C<$!> 成  C<EPIPE>。

注意, 不同于读取的队列中的请求，使用 on_read 是可能读不到数据，比如读到了一个 EOF 但时还有未完成的读取请求，但这时会标记成错误，所以当 on_read 调用时，就会调用 on_eof.

=item on_eof => $cb->($handle)

当检查到文件结束的时候调用本设置的回调函数。当一个 socket 连接时，对方干净利落地关掉了连接并且队列中没有未完成的读请求。如果这时还有读请求，这个 EOF 被认为是意外的连接关闭，会标记为错误。

对于套接字，这也就意味着，对方已经停止发送数据，你仍然可以尝试写数据时， 因为可以返回 EOF 回调和还是能继续写入数据，因为只有读的部分已经被关闭。

如果发现了 EOF 但并没有设置 C<on_eof> 的回调函数，这时 fatal 的错误中  C<$!> 会设置成 0.

=item on_drain => $cb->($handle)

当写的 buffer 变成空的时候，会调用这个设置的回调。(设置可以在句柄设置的时候创建这个).

我们追加东西到写缓冲区中，只要使用 C<< ->push_write >>  的方法就行了。

这个回调非常的有用，当你不想给的有的数据一次性的写入到写队列时。例如：当你想给一些文件的内容写到 socket 中。但你并不想一次给整个文件都读到内存中来然后推到队列中。所以我们常用的方法是当写队列变成空的时候我们读更多的内容追加写到写队列。

=item timeout => $fractional_seconds

=item rtimeout => $fractional_seconds

=item wtimeout => $fractional_seconds

上面的参数只要不是为零，对于不活动的连接就会激活超时断开: 当这些句柄正常的读和写时超过多少秒时(或调用 C<timeout_reset>)，这个 C<on_timeout> 的回调就会被调用(如果这个回调不存在，会引起 C<ETIMEDOUT> 的错误).

在 AnyEvent 中有三种不同的超时，这三种不同的超时相互独立，同时作用于读取和写入的超时（触发在没有读 I<OR> 写时),只和读有关的超时(触发在没有读)和只和写有关的超时(触发没有写时):  C<timeout>, C<rtimeout> and C<wtimeout>,与相应的回调是  C<on_timeout>, C<on_rtimeout> 和 C<on_wtimeout> 和重置功能  C<timeout_reset>, C<rtimeout_reset>, 和 C<wtimeout_reset>。

注意这个超时，如果你一段时间没有读取和写入的请求时，只要打开了它就会工作，所以如果你打算保持这种空闲的连接，你需要暂时禁用超时或忽略  C<on_timeout> 这个超时的回调，象  AnyEvent::Handle 中会直接重设超时.                                                                                                                                                                                

零 （默认） 禁用相应的超时。

=item on_timeout => $cb->($handle)

=item on_rtimeout => $cb->($handle)

=item on_wtimeout => $cb->($handle)

闲置多久后超时然后调用回调。如果这个回调 return 时这个超时会被重置。只要有活动发生，这个就不会发生.

=item rbuf_max => <bytes>

If defined, then a fatal error will be raised (with C<$!> set to C<ENOSPC>)
when the read buffer ever (strictly) exceeds this size. This is useful to
avoid some forms of denial-of-service attacks.

For example, a server accepting connections from untrusted sources should
be configured to accept only so-and-so much data that it cannot act on
(for example, when expecting a line, an attacker could send an unlimited
amount of data without a callback ever being called as long as the line
isn't finished).

=item wbuf_max => <bytes>

If defined, then a fatal error will be raised (with C<$!> set to C<ENOSPC>)
when the write buffer ever (strictly) exceeds this size. This is useful to
avoid some forms of denial-of-service attacks.

Although the units of this parameter is bytes, this is the I<raw> number
of bytes not yet accepted by the kernel. This can make a difference when
you e.g. use TLS, as TLS typically makes your write data larger (but it
can also make it smaller due to compression).

As an example of when this limit is useful, take a chat server that sends
chat messages to a client. If the client does not read those in a timely
manner then the send buffer in the server would grow unbounded.

=item autocork => <boolean>

When disabled (the default), C<push_write> will try to immediately
write the data to the handle if possible. This avoids having to register
a write watcher and wait for the next event loop iteration, but can
be inefficient if you write multiple small chunks (on the wire, this
disadvantage is usually avoided by your kernel's nagle algorithm, see
C<no_delay>, but this option can save costly syscalls).

When enabled, writes will always be queued till the next event loop
iteration. This is efficient when you do many small writes per iteration,
but less efficient when you do a single write only per iteration (or when
the write buffer often is full). It also increases write latency.

=item no_delay => <boolean>

当你写在 sockets 上写少量数据时，你的操作系统的内核通常会在发送这些数据之前，等更加多的数据然后一起发送。这调用和设置的是 Nagle 的算法，这个可能对你可能有用。

如果你想有更加低延时数据发送，你可以设置这个选项为 true .

这个默认是使用操作系统的缺省的行为(大多是加打开这选项).  这个选项提供给你一个明确的可以设置它的地方。

=item keepalive => <boolean>

启用(默认是禁用)  stream socket 中的 SO_KEEPALIVE 的选项。通常情况下，TCP 连接一旦建立并不会超时。所以，可以一直保持活的状态。TCP 的连接保持是一种非常好的提高传送性能的方式。使用长保持 TCP 连接可以直到另一边的连接不可用时。默认的超时是依赖于操作系统的，通常能在开始生效后保持大约 2 小时。当另一端的连接没有反应时，断开这个 TCP 连接大约是 10 -15 分钟后.

大多的时候指定这个选项，并不会产生什么不好的影响。除非不支持这个选项。打开这个选项通常是个非常好的主意。

=item oobinline => <boolean>

BSD majorly fucked up the implementation of TCP urgent data. The result
is that almost no OS implements TCP according to the specs, and every OS
implements it slightly differently.

If you want to handle TCP urgent data, then setting this flag (the default
is enabled) gives you the most portable way of getting urgent data, by
putting it into the stream.

Since BSD emulation of OOB data on top of TCP's urgent data can have
security implications, AnyEvent::Handle sets this flag automatically
unless explicitly specified. Note that setting this flag after
establishing a connection I<may> be a bit too late (data loss could
already have occured on BSD systems), but at least it will protect you
from most attacks.

=item read_size => <bytes>

The initial read block size, the number of bytes this module will try
to read during each loop iteration. Each handle object will consume
at least this amount of memory for the read buffer as well, so when
handling many connections watch out for memory requirements). See also
C<max_read_size>. Default: C<2048>.

=item max_read_size => <bytes>

The maximum read buffer size used by the dynamic adjustment
algorithm: Each time AnyEvent::Handle can read C<read_size> bytes in
one go it will double C<read_size> up to the maximum given by this
option. Default: C<131072> or C<read_size>, whichever is higher.

=item low_water_mark => <bytes>

Sets the number of bytes (default: C<0>) that make up an "empty" write
buffer: If the buffer reaches this size or gets even samller it is
considered empty.

Sometimes it can be beneficial (for performance reasons) to add data to
the write buffer before it is fully drained, but this is a rare case, as
the operating system kernel usually buffers data as well, so the default
is good in almost all cases.

=item linger => <seconds>

If this is non-zero (default: C<3600>), the destructor of the
AnyEvent::Handle object will check whether there is still outstanding
write data and will install a watcher that will write this data to the
socket. No errors will be reported (this mostly matches how the operating
system treats outstanding data at socket close time).

This will not work for partial TLS data that could not be encoded
yet. This data will be lost. Calling the C<stoptls> method in time might
help.

=item peername => $string

A string used to identify the remote site - usually the DNS hostname
(I<not> IDN!) used to create the connection, rarely the IP address.

Apart from being useful in error messages, this string is also used in TLS
peername verification (see C<verify_peername> in L<AnyEvent::TLS>). This
verification will be skipped when C<peername> is not specified or is
C<undef>.

=item tls => "accept" | "connect" | Net::SSLeay::SSL object

When this parameter is given, it enables TLS (SSL) mode, that means
AnyEvent will start a TLS handshake as soon as the connection has been
established and will transparently encrypt/decrypt data afterwards.

All TLS protocol errors will be signalled as C<EPROTO>, with an
appropriate error message.

TLS mode requires Net::SSLeay to be installed (it will be loaded
automatically when you try to create a TLS handle): this module doesn't
have a dependency on that module, so if your module requires it, you have
to add the dependency yourself. If Net::SSLeay cannot be loaded or is too
old, you get an C<EPROTO> error.

Unlike TCP, TLS has a server and client side: for the TLS server side, use
C<accept>, and for the TLS client side of a connection, use C<connect>
mode.

You can also provide your own TLS connection object, but you have
to make sure that you call either C<Net::SSLeay::set_connect_state>
or C<Net::SSLeay::set_accept_state> on it before you pass it to
AnyEvent::Handle. Also, this module will take ownership of this connection
object.

At some future point, AnyEvent::Handle might switch to another TLS
implementation, then the option to use your own session object will go
away.

B<IMPORTANT:> since Net::SSLeay "objects" are really only integers,
passing in the wrong integer will lead to certain crash. This most often
happens when one uses a stylish C<< tls => 1 >> and is surprised about the
segmentation fault.

Use the C<< ->starttls >> method if you need to start TLS negotiation later.

=item tls_ctx => $anyevent_tls

Use the given C<AnyEvent::TLS> object to create the new TLS connection
(unless a connection object was specified directly). If this
parameter is missing (or C<undef>), then AnyEvent::Handle will use
C<AnyEvent::Handle::TLS_CTX>.

Instead of an object, you can also specify a hash reference with C<< key
=> value >> pairs. Those will be passed to L<AnyEvent::TLS> to create a
new TLS context object.

=item on_starttls => $cb->($handle, $success[, $error_message])

This callback will be invoked when the TLS/SSL handshake has finished. If
C<$success> is true, then the TLS handshake succeeded, otherwise it failed
(C<on_stoptls> will not be called in this case).

The session in C<< $handle->{tls} >> can still be examined in this
callback, even when the handshake was not successful.

TLS handshake failures will not cause C<on_error> to be invoked when this
callback is in effect, instead, the error message will be passed to C<on_starttls>.

Without this callback, handshake failures lead to C<on_error> being
called as usual.

Note that you cannot just call C<starttls> again in this callback. If you
need to do that, start an zero-second timer instead whose callback can
then call C<< ->starttls >> again.

=item on_stoptls => $cb->($handle)

When a SSLv3/TLS shutdown/close notify/EOF is detected and this callback is
set, then it will be invoked after freeing the TLS session. If it is not,
then a TLS shutdown condition will be treated like a normal EOF condition
on the handle.

The session in C<< $handle->{tls} >> can still be examined in this
callback.

This callback will only be called on TLS shutdowns, not when the
underlying handle signals EOF.

=item json => JSON or JSON::XS object

This is the json coder object used by the C<json> read and write types.

If you don't supply it, then AnyEvent::Handle will create and use a
suitable one (on demand), which will write and expect UTF-8 encoded JSON
texts.

Note that you are responsible to depend on the JSON module if you want to
use this functionality, as AnyEvent does not have a dependency itself.

=head2 WRITE QUEUE

AnyEvent::Handle manages two queues per handle, one for writing and one
for reading.

The write queue is very simple: you can add data to its end, and
AnyEvent::Handle will automatically try to get rid of it for you.

When data could be written and the write buffer is shorter then the low
water mark, the C<on_drain> callback will be invoked once.

=over 4

=item $handle->on_drain ($cb)

Sets the C<on_drain> callback or clears it (see the description of
C<on_drain> in the constructor).

This method may invoke callbacks (and therefore the handle might be
destroyed after it returns).

=cut

sub on_drain {
   my ($self, $cb) = @_;

   $self->{on_drain} = $cb;

   $cb->($self)
      if $cb && $self->{low_water_mark} >= (length $self->{wbuf}) + (length $self->{_tls_wbuf});
}

=item $handle->push_write ($data)

Queues the given scalar to be written. You can push as much data as
you want (only limited by the available memory and C<wbuf_max>), as
C<AnyEvent::Handle> buffers it independently of the kernel.

This method may invoke callbacks (and therefore the handle might be
destroyed after it returns).

=cut

sub _drain_wbuf {
   my ($self) = @_;

=item $handle->push_write (type => @args)

Instead of formatting your data yourself, you can also let this module
do the job by specifying a type and type-specific arguments. You
can also specify the (fully qualified) name of a package, in which
case AnyEvent tries to load the package and then expects to find the
C<anyevent_write_type> function inside (see "custom write types", below).

Predefined types are (if you have ideas for additional types, feel free to
drop by and tell us):

=over 4

=item netstring => $string

Formats the given value as netstring
(http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt, this is not a recommendation to use them).

=cut

register_write_type netstring => sub {
   my ($self, $string) = @_;

   (length $string) . ":$string,"
};

=item packstring => $format, $data

An octet string prefixed with an encoded length. The encoding C<$format>
uses the same format as a Perl C<pack> format, but must specify a single
integer only (only one of C<cCsSlLqQiInNvVjJw> is allowed, plus an
optional C<!>, C<< < >> or C<< > >> modifier).

=cut

register_write_type packstring => sub {
   my ($self, $format, $string) = @_;

   pack "$format/a*", $string
};

=item json => $array_or_hashref

Encodes the given hash or array reference into a JSON object. Unless you
provide your own JSON object, this means it will be encoded to JSON text
in UTF-8.

JSON objects (and arrays) are self-delimiting, so you can write JSON at
one end of a handle and read them at the other end without using any
additional framing.

The generated JSON text is guaranteed not to contain any newlines: While
this module doesn't need delimiters after or between JSON texts to be
able to read them, many other languages depend on that.

A simple RPC protocol that interoperates easily with others is to send
JSON arrays (or objects, although arrays are usually the better choice as
they mimic how function argument passing works) and a newline after each
JSON text:

   $handle->push_write (json => ["method", "arg1", "arg2"]); # whatever
   $handle->push_write ("\012");
 
An AnyEvent::Handle receiver would simply use the C<json> read type and
rely on the fact that the newline will be skipped as leading whitespace:

   $handle->push_read (json => sub { my $array = $_[1]; ... });

Other languages could read single lines terminated by a newline and pass
this line into their JSON decoder of choice.

=cut

sub json_coder() {
   eval { require JSON::XS; JSON::XS->new->utf8 }
      || do { require JSON; JSON->new->utf8 }
}

register_write_type json => sub {
   my ($self, $ref) = @_;

   my $json = $self->{json} ||= json_coder;

   $json->encode ($ref)
};

=item storable => $reference

Freezes the given reference using L<Storable> and writes it to the
handle. Uses the C<nfreeze> format.

=cut

register_write_type storable => sub {
   my ($self, $ref) = @_;

   require Storable unless $Storable::VERSION;

   pack "w/a*", Storable::nfreeze ($ref)
};

=back

=item $handle->push_shutdown

Sometimes you know you want to close the socket after writing your data
before it was actually written. One way to do that is to replace your
C<on_drain> handler by a callback that shuts down the socket (and set
C<low_water_mark> to C<0>). This method is a shorthand for just that, and
replaces the C<on_drain> callback with:

   sub { shutdown $_[0]{fh}, 1 }

This simply shuts down the write side and signals an EOF condition to the
the peer.

You can rely on the normal read queue and C<on_eof> handling
afterwards. This is the cleanest way to close a connection.

This method may invoke callbacks (and therefore the handle might be
destroyed after it returns).

=cut

sub push_shutdown {
   my ($self) = @_;

   delete $self->{low_water_mark};
   $self->on_drain (sub { shutdown $_[0]{fh}, 1 });
}

=item custom write types - Package::anyevent_write_type $handle, @args

Instead of one of the predefined types, you can also specify the name of
a package. AnyEvent will try to load the package and then expects to find
a function named C<anyevent_write_type> inside. If it isn't found, it
progressively tries to load the parent package until it either finds the
function (good) or runs out of packages (bad).

Whenever the given C<type> is used, C<push_write> will the function with
the handle object and the remaining arguments.

The function is supposed to return a single octet string that will be
appended to the write buffer, so you can mentally treat this function as a
"arguments to on-the-wire-format" converter.

Example: implement a custom write type C<join> that joins the remaining
arguments using the first one.

   $handle->push_write (My::Type => " ", 1,2,3);

   # uses the following package, which can be defined in the "My::Type" or in
   # the "My" modules to be auto-loaded, or just about anywhere when the
   # My::Type::anyevent_write_type is defined before invoking it.

   package My::Type;

   sub anyevent_write_type {
      my ($handle, $delim, @args) = @_;

      join $delim, @args
   }

=head2 READ QUEUE

AnyEvent::Handle manages two queues per handle, one for writing and one
for reading.

The read queue is more complex than the write queue. It can be used in two
ways, the "simple" way, using only C<on_read> and the "complex" way, using
a queue.

In the simple case, you just install an C<on_read> callback and whenever
new data arrives, it will be called. You can then remove some data (if
enough is there) from the read buffer (C<< $handle->rbuf >>). Or you can
leave the data there if you want to accumulate more (e.g. when only a
partial message has been received so far), or change the read queue with
e.g. C<push_read>.

In the more complex case, you want to queue multiple callbacks. In this
case, AnyEvent::Handle will call the first queued callback each time new
data arrives (also the first time it is queued) and remove it when it has
done its job (see C<push_read>, below).

This way you can, for example, push three line-reads, followed by reading
a chunk of data, and AnyEvent::Handle will execute them in order.

Example 1: EPP protocol parser. EPP sends 4 byte length info, followed by
the specified number of bytes which give an XML datagram.

   # in the default state, expect some header bytes
   $handle->on_read (sub {
      # some data is here, now queue the length-header-read (4 octets)
      shift->unshift_read (chunk => 4, sub {
         # header arrived, decode
         my $len = unpack "N", $_[1];

         # now read the payload
         shift->unshift_read (chunk => $len, sub {
            my $xml = $_[1];
            # handle xml
         });
      });
   });

Example 2: Implement a client for a protocol that replies either with "OK"
and another line or "ERROR" for the first request that is sent, and 64
bytes for the second request. Due to the availability of a queue, we can
just pipeline sending both requests and manipulate the queue as necessary
in the callbacks.

When the first callback is called and sees an "OK" response, it will
C<unshift> another line-read. This line-read will be queued I<before> the
64-byte chunk callback.

   # request one, returns either "OK + extra line" or "ERROR"
   $handle->push_write ("request 1\015\012");

   # we expect "ERROR" or "OK" as response, so push a line read
   $handle->push_read (line => sub {
      # if we got an "OK", we have to _prepend_ another line,
      # so it will be read before the second request reads its 64 bytes
      # which are already in the queue when this callback is called
      # we don't do this in case we got an error
      if ($_[1] eq "OK") {
         $_[0]->unshift_read (line => sub {
            my $response = $_[1];
            ...
         });
      }
   });

   # request two, simply returns 64 octets
   $handle->push_write ("request 2\015\012");

   # simply read 64 bytes, always
   $handle->push_read (chunk => 64, sub {
      my $response = $_[1];
      ...
   });

=item $handle->rbuf

Returns the read buffer (as a modifiable lvalue). You can also access the
read buffer directly as the C<< ->{rbuf} >> member, if you want (this is
much faster, and no less clean).

The only operation allowed on the read buffer (apart from looking at it)
is removing data from its beginning. Otherwise modifying or appending to
it is not allowed and will lead to hard-to-track-down bugs.

NOTE: The read buffer should only be used or modified in the C<on_read>
callback or when C<push_read> or C<unshift_read> are used with a single
callback (i.e. untyped). Typed C<push_read> and C<unshift_read> methods
will manage the read buffer on their own.

=cut

=item $handle->push_read ($cb)

=item $handle->unshift_read ($cb)

Append the given callback to the end of the queue (C<push_read>) or
prepend it (C<unshift_read>).

The callback is called each time some additional read data arrives.

It must check whether enough data is in the read buffer already.

If not enough data is available, it must return the empty list or a false
value, in which case it will be called repeatedly until enough data is
available (or an error condition is detected).

If enough data was available, then the callback must remove all data it is
interested in (which can be none at all) and return a true value. After returning
true, it will be removed from the queue.

These methods may invoke callbacks (and therefore the handle might be
destroyed after it returns).

=item chunk => $octets, $cb->($handle, $data)

Invoke the callback only once C<$octets> bytes have been read. Pass the
data read to the callback. The callback will never be called with less
data.

Example: read 2 bytes.

   $handle->push_read (chunk => 2, sub {
      say "yay " . unpack "H*", $_[1];
   });

      1
   }
};

=item line => [$eol, ]$cb->($handle, $line, $eol)

The callback will be called only once a full line (including the end of
line marker, C<$eol>) has been read. This line (excluding the end of line
marker) will be passed to the callback as second argument (C<$line>), and
the end of line marker as the third argument (C<$eol>).

The end of line marker, C<$eol>, can be either a string, in which case it
will be interpreted as a fixed record end marker, or it can be a regex
object (e.g. created by C<qr>), in which case it is interpreted as a
regular expression.

The end of line marker argument C<$eol> is optional, if it is missing (NOT
undef), then C<qr|\015?\012|> is used (which is good for most internet
protocols).

Partial lines at the end of the stream will never be returned, as they are
not marked by the end of line marker.

=cut

register_read_type line => sub {
   my ($self, $cb, $eol) = @_;

   if (@_ < 3) {
      # this is more than twice as fast as the generic code below

         $_[0]{rbuf} =~ s/^([^\015\012]*)(\015?\012)// or return;

         $cb->($_[0], "$1", "$2");
         1
      }
   }
};

=item regex => $accept[, $reject[, $skip], $cb->($handle, $data)

使用正则表达式的对象 C<$accept> 来进行正则表达式匹配,并返回所有的正则之前的东西和匹配的内容.

例如: 读一个以  '\n' 做为结束符的单选.

   $handle->push_read (regex => qr<\n>, sub { ... });

如果 C<$reject> 这个地方定义了时(不为 undef)，那么当出现这种确认的数据时就会被拒绝：它是指当 $accept 的正则不匹配时，而这个本身匹配的数据时全生成一个 C<EBADMSG> 的错. 

这是非常有用的，可以快速地拒绝错误数据（以避免等待超时或接收缓冲区溢出）。

例如：我们需要一个十进制数,之后是空白,只要不对,拒绝其他任何东西.

   $handle->push_read (regex => qr<^[0-9]+\s>, qr<[^0-9]>, sub { ... });

如果 C<$skip> 个地方定义了时(不为 undef)，那么当 C<$accept> 找到了相关的内容和 C<$reject> 并不匹配时，它会检查接收到的 buffer.这是非常有用的，可以跳过你知道不匹配大量的数据.


这是纯粹的优化，通常是值得的，大量要跳过的数据的时候, 使  C<$accept>  or C<$reject> 的正则表达式就不需要从一开始就匹配找起.

例如: 我们需要抓 HTTP 的 header, 结束符是 C<\015\012\015\012>. 由于我们预计 header 是非常大的。 

我们使用 skip 的正则表达式跳过起始部分.  在这 skip 的正则表达式有点刁钻，因为 \015 和 \012 都是结束符.所以这些都需要使用正则。

   $handle->push_read (regex =>
      qr<\015\012\015\012>,
      undef, # no reject
      qr<^.*[^\015\012]>,

=item packstring => $format, $cb->($handle, $string)

uses the same format as a Perl C<pack> format, but must specify a single
integer only (only one of C<cCsSlLqQiInNvVjJw> is allowed, plus an
optional C<!>, C<< < >> or C<< > >> modifier).

For example, DNS over TCP uses a prefix of C<n> (2 octet network order),
EPP uses a prefix of C<N> (4 octtes).

Example: read a block of data prefixed by its length in BER-encoded
format (very efficient).

=item json => $cb->($handle, $hash_or_arrayref)

Reads a JSON object or array, decodes it and passes it to the
callback. When a parse error occurs, an C<EBADMSG> error will be raised.

If a C<json> object was passed to the constructor, then that will be used
for the final decode, otherwise it will create a JSON coder expecting UTF-8.

This read type uses the incremental parser available with JSON version
2.09 (and JSON::XS version 2.2) and above. You have to provide a
dependency on your own: this module will load the JSON module, but
AnyEvent does not depend on it itself.

Since JSON texts are fully self-delimiting, the C<json> read and write
types are an ideal simple RPC protocol: just exchange JSON datagrams. See
the C<json> write type description, above, for an actual example.

=item tls_detect => $cb->($handle, $detect, $major, $minor)

Checks the input stream for a valid SSL or TLS handshake TLSPaintext
record without consuming anything. Only SSL version 3 or higher
is handled, up to the fictituous protocol 4.x (but both SSL3+ and
SSL2-compatible framing is supported).

If it detects that the input data is likely TLS, it calls the callback
with a true value for C<$detect> and the (on-wire) TLS version as second
and third argument (C<$major> is C<3>, and C<$minor> is 0..3 for SSL
3.0, TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2, respectively).  If it detects the input to
be definitely not TLS, it calls the callback with a false value for
C<$detect>.

The callback could use this information to decide whether or not to start
TLS negotiation.

In all cases the data read so far is passed to the following read
handlers.

Usually you want to use the C<tls_autostart> read type instead.

If you want to design a protocol that works in the presence of TLS
dtection, make sure that any non-TLS data doesn't start with the octet 22
(ASCII SYN, 16 hex) or 128-255 (i.e. highest bit set). The checks this
read type does are a bit more strict, but might losen in the future to
accomodate protocol changes.

This read type does not rely on L<AnyEvent::TLS> (and thus, not on
L<Net::SSLeay>).

=item tls_autostart => $tls[, $tls_ctx]

Tries to detect a valid SSL or TLS handshake. If one is detected, it tries
to start tls by calling C<starttls> with the given arguments.

In practise, C<$tls> must be C<accept>, or a Net::SSLeay context that has
been configured to accept, as servers do not normally send a handshake on
their own and ths cannot be detected in this way.

See C<tls_detect> above for more details.

Example: give the client a chance to start TLS before accepting a text
line.

   $hdl->push_read (tls_detect => "accept");
   $hdl->push_read (line => sub {
      print "received ", ($_[0]{tls} ? "encrypted" : "cleartext"), " <$_[1]>\n";

=item custom read types - Package::anyevent_read_type $handle, $cb, @args

Instead of one of the predefined types, you can also specify the name
of a package. AnyEvent will try to load the package and then expects to
find a function named C<anyevent_read_type> inside. If it isn't found, it
progressively tries to load the parent package until it either finds the
function (good) or runs out of packages (bad).

Whenever this type is used, C<push_read> will invoke the function with the
handle object, the original callback and the remaining arguments.

The function is supposed to return a callback (usually a closure) that
works as a plain read callback (see C<< ->push_read ($cb) >>), so you can
mentally treat the function as a "configurable read type to read callback"
converter.

It should invoke the original callback when it is done reading (remember
to pass C<$handle> as first argument as all other callbacks do that,
although there is no strict requirement on this).

For examples, see the source of this module (F<perldoc -m
AnyEvent::Handle>, search for C<register_read_type>)).

=item $handle->stop_read

=item $handle->start_read

In rare cases you actually do not want to read anything from the
socket. In this case you can call C<stop_read>. Neither C<on_read> nor
any queued callbacks will be executed then. To start reading again, call
C<start_read>.

Note that AnyEvent::Handle will automatically C<start_read> for you when
you change the C<on_read> callback or push/unshift a read callback, and it
will automatically C<stop_read> for you when neither C<on_read> is set nor
there are any read requests in the queue.

In older versions of this module (<= 5.3), these methods had no effect,
as TLS does not support half-duplex connections. In current versions they
work as expected, as this behaviour is required to avoid certain resource
attacks, where the program would be forced to read (and buffer) arbitrary
amounts of data before being able to send some data. The drawback is that
some readings of the the SSL/TLS specifications basically require this
attack to be working, as SSL/TLS implementations might stall sending data
during a rehandshake.

As a guideline, during the initial handshake, you should not stop reading,
and as a client, it might cause problems, depending on your application.

=item $handle->starttls ($tls[, $tls_ctx])

Instead of starting TLS negotiation immediately when the AnyEvent::Handle
object is created, you can also do that at a later time by calling
C<starttls>. See the C<tls> constructor argument for general info.

Starting TLS is currently an asynchronous operation - when you push some
write data and then call C<< ->starttls >> then TLS negotiation will start
immediately, after which the queued write data is then sent. This might
change in future versions, so best make sure you have no outstanding write
data when calling this method.

The first argument is the same as the C<tls> constructor argument (either
C<"connect">, C<"accept"> or an existing Net::SSLeay object).

The second argument is the optional C<AnyEvent::TLS> object that is used
when AnyEvent::Handle has to create its own TLS connection object, or
a hash reference with C<< key => value >> pairs that will be used to
construct a new context.

The TLS connection object will end up in C<< $handle->{tls} >>, the TLS
context in C<< $handle->{tls_ctx} >> after this call and can be used or
changed to your liking. Note that the handshake might have already started
when this function returns.

Due to bugs in OpenSSL, it might or might not be possible to do multiple
handshakes on the same stream. It is best to not attempt to use the
stream after stopping TLS.

This method may invoke callbacks (and therefore the handle might be
destroyed after it returns).

=item $handle->destroy

Shuts down the handle object as much as possible - this call ensures that
no further callbacks will be invoked and as many resources as possible
will be freed. Any method you will call on the handle object after
destroying it in this way will be silently ignored (and it will return the
empty list).

Normally, you can just "forget" any references to an AnyEvent::Handle
object and it will simply shut down. This works in fatal error and EOF
callbacks, as well as code outside. It does I<NOT> work in a read or write
callback, so when you want to destroy the AnyEvent::Handle object from
within such an callback. You I<MUST> call C<< ->destroy >> explicitly in
that case.

Destroying the handle object in this way has the advantage that callbacks
will be removed as well, so if those are the only reference holders (as
is common), then one doesn't need to do anything special to break any
reference cycles.

The handle might still linger in the background and write out remaining
data, as specified by the C<linger> option, however.

sub AnyEvent::Handle::destroyed::AUTOLOAD {
   #nop
}

=item $handle->destroyed

Returns false as long as the handle hasn't been destroyed by a call to C<<
->destroy >>, true otherwise.

Can be useful to decide whether the handle is still valid after some
callback possibly destroyed the handle. For example, C<< ->push_write >>,
C<< ->starttls >> and other methods can call user callbacks, which in turn
can destroy the handle, so work can be avoided by checking sometimes:

   $hdl->starttls ("accept");
   return if $hdl->destroyed;
   $hdl->push_write (...

Note that the call to C<push_write> will silently be ignored if the handle
has been destroyed, so often you can just ignore the possibility of the
handle being destroyed.

=head1 NONFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

=over 4

=item I C<undef> the AnyEvent::Handle reference inside my callback and
still get further invocations!

That's because AnyEvent::Handle keeps a reference to itself when handling
read or write callbacks.

It is only safe to "forget" the reference inside EOF or error callbacks,
from within all other callbacks, you need to explicitly call the C<<
->destroy >> method.

=item 为什么我的 C<on_eof> 回调从来没有被调用过?

可能是因为你的 C<on_error> 回调被其它的方法替代： 当你的读队列中有没有完成的请求，然后
Probably because your C<on_error> callback is being called instead: When you have outstanding requests in your read queue, then an EOF is considered an error as you clearly expected some data.

To avoid this, make sure you have an empty read queue whenever your handle
is supposed to be "idle" (i.e. connection closes are O.K.). You can set
an C<on_read> handler that simply pushes the first read requests in the
queue.

See also the next question, which explains this in a bit more detail.

=item How can I serve requests in a loop?

Most protocols consist of some setup phase (authentication for example)
followed by a request handling phase, where the server waits for requests
and handles them, in a loop.

There are two important variants: The first (traditional, better) variant
handles requests until the server gets some QUIT command, causing it to
close the connection first (highly desirable for a busy TCP server). A
client dropping the connection is an error, which means this variant can
detect an unexpected detection close.

To handle this case, always make sure you have a non-empty read queue, by
pushing the "read request start" handler on it:

   # we assume a request starts with a single line
   my @start_request; @start_request = (line => sub {
      my ($hdl, $line) = @_;

      ... handle request

      # push next request read, possibly from a nested callback
      $hdl->push_read (@start_request);
   });

   # auth done, now go into request handling loop
   # now push the first @start_request
   $hdl->push_read (@start_request);

By always having an outstanding C<push_read>, the handle always expects
some data and raises the C<EPIPE> error when the connction is dropped
unexpectedly.

The second variant is a protocol where the client can drop the connection
at any time. For TCP, this means that the server machine may run out of
sockets easier, and in general, it means you cannot distinguish a protocl
failure/client crash from a normal connection close. Nevertheless, these
kinds of protocols are common (and sometimes even the best solution to the
problem).

Having an outstanding read request at all times is possible if you ignore
C<EPIPE> errors, but this doesn't help with when the client drops the
connection during a request, which would still be an error.

A better solution is to push the initial request read in an C<on_read>
callback. This avoids an error, as when the server doesn't expect data
(i.e. is idly waiting for the next request, an EOF will not raise an
error, but simply result in an C<on_eof> callback. It is also a bit slower
and simpler:

   # auth done, now go into request handling loop
   $hdl->on_read (sub {
      my ($hdl) = @_;

      # called each time we receive data but the read queue is empty
      # simply start read the request

      $hdl->push_read (line => sub {
         my ($hdl, $line) = @_;

         ... handle request

         # do nothing special when the request has been handled, just
         # let the request queue go empty.
      });
   });

=item I get different callback invocations in TLS mode/Why can't I pause
reading?

Unlike, say, TCP, TLS connections do not consist of two independent
communication channels, one for each direction. Or put differently, the
read and write directions are not independent of each other: you cannot
write data unless you are also prepared to read, and vice versa.

This means that, in TLS mode, you might get C<on_error> or C<on_eof>
callback invocations when you are not expecting any read data - the reason
is that AnyEvent::Handle always reads in TLS mode.

During the connection, you have to make sure that you always have a
non-empty read-queue, or an C<on_read> watcher. At the end of the
connection (or when you no longer want to use it) you can call the
C<destroy> method.

=item 我该如何读取数据，直到对方关闭了连接, 

如果你只是想读一些数据到 Perl 中。非常容易实现， 只需要设置 C<on_read>  的回调不做任何事情和清空  C<on_eof> 。然后在设置一些在  C<on_error> 的回调中处理 C<$_[0]{rbuf}> 的数据就好了。

   $handle->on_read (sub { });
   $handle->on_eof (undef);
   $handle->on_error (sub {
      my $data = delete $_[0]{rbuf};
   });

注意这个例子中从对象的句柄中删除 C<rbuf> 的成员，这并不是一个标准的 API 。如果标准的删除这个对象，需要析构这个对象。

上面之所以在 TCP 的连接中使用 C<on_error> 来读取数据是因为有可能因为延迟和数据包丢失，连接突然关闭，但其实已经收到的所有数据。

它通常是更好的方法是，一定要使用确认机制，在数据传输时确保对方真的断开了，你有得到了完整的数据。这也是为什么有这么多的网络协议有一个明确的 QUIT 命令的原因。

=item I don't want to destroy the handle too early - how do I wait until
all data has been written?

After writing your last bits of data, set the C<on_drain> callback
and destroy the handle in there - with the default setting of
C<low_water_mark> this will be called precisely when all data has been
written to the socket:

   $handle->push_write (...);
   $handle->on_drain (sub {
      AE::log debug => "All data submitted to the kernel.";
      undef $handle;
   });

If you just want to queue some data and then signal EOF to the other side,
consider using C<< ->push_shutdown >> instead.

=item I want to contact a TLS/SSL server, I don't care about security.

If your TLS server is a pure TLS server (e.g. HTTPS) that only speaks TLS,
connect to it and then create the AnyEvent::Handle with the C<tls>
parameter:

   tcp_connect $host, $port, sub {
      my ($fh) = @_;

      my $handle = new AnyEvent::Handle
         fh  => $fh,
         tls => "connect",
         on_error => sub { ... };

      $handle->push_write (...);
   };

=item I want to contact a TLS/SSL server, I do care about security.

Then you should additionally enable certificate verification, including
peername verification, if the protocol you use supports it (see
L<AnyEvent::TLS>, C<verify_peername>).

E.g. for HTTPS:

   tcp_connect $host, $port, sub {
      my ($fh) = @_;

       my $handle = new AnyEvent::Handle
          fh       => $fh,
          peername => $host,
          tls      => "connect",
          tls_ctx  => { verify => 1, verify_peername => "https" },
          ...

Note that you must specify the hostname you connected to (or whatever
"peername" the protocol needs) as the C<peername> argument, otherwise no
peername verification will be done.

The above will use the system-dependent default set of trusted CA
certificates. If you want to check against a specific CA, add the
C<ca_file> (or C<ca_cert>) arguments to C<tls_ctx>:

       tls_ctx  => {
          verify          => 1,
          verify_peername => "https",
          ca_file         => "my-ca-cert.pem",
       },

=item I want to create a TLS/SSL server, how do I do that?

Well, you first need to get a server certificate and key. You have
three options: a) ask a CA (buy one, use cacert.org etc.) b) create a
self-signed certificate (cheap. check the search engine of your choice,
there are many tutorials on the net) or c) make your own CA (tinyca2 is a
nice program for that purpose).

Then create a file with your private key (in PEM format, see
L<AnyEvent::TLS>), followed by the certificate (also in PEM format). The
file should then look like this:

   -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
   ...header data
   ... lots of base64'y-stuff
   -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   ... lots of base64'y-stuff
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----

The important bits are the "PRIVATE KEY" and "CERTIFICATE" parts.  Then
specify this file as C<cert_file>:

   tcp_server undef, $port, sub {
      my ($fh) = @_;

      my $handle = new AnyEvent::Handle
         fh       => $fh,
         tls      => "accept",
         tls_ctx  => { cert_file => "my-server-keycert.pem" },
         ...

When you have intermediate CA certificates that your clients might not
know about, just append them to the C<cert_file>.

=head1 SUBCLASSING AnyEvent::Handle

In many cases, you might want to subclass AnyEvent::Handle.

To make this easier, a given version of AnyEvent::Handle uses these
conventions:

=over 4

=item * all constructor arguments become object members.

At least initially, when you pass a C<tls>-argument to the constructor it
will end up in C<< $handle->{tls} >>. Those members might be changed or
mutated later on (for example C<tls> will hold the TLS connection object).

=item * other object member names are prefixed with an C<_>.

All object members not explicitly documented (internal use) are prefixed
with an underscore character, so the remaining non-C<_>-namespace is free
for use for subclasses.

=item * all members not documented here and not prefixed with an underscore
are free to use in subclasses.

Of course, new versions of AnyEvent::Handle may introduce more "public"
member variables, but that's just life. At least it is documented.
